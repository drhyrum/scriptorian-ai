# Installation Summary - Auto-Indexing Feature

## What Changed

The Scriptorian installation process now includes **automatic scripture indexing** during setup, making semantic search available immediately.

## New Files

### 1. `scripts/index_scriptures.py` (185 lines)
Standalone indexing script that:
- Loads all scripture verses
- Generates AI embeddings using sentence-transformers
- Stores in ChromaDB vector database
- Shows real-time progress tracking
- Provides detailed statistics on completion
- Handles re-indexing with user confirmation

**Usage:**
```bash
python scripts/index_scriptures.py
```

### 2. `INDEXING.md` (Complete Guide)
Comprehensive documentation covering:
- What indexing is and why it's needed
- Installation options (automatic vs manual)
- Re-indexing procedures
- Database details and storage
- Performance metrics
- Troubleshooting guide
- Advanced usage examples

## Modified Files

### 1. `install.sh`
**Added:** Interactive prompt for indexing during installation

**New Flow:**
1. Install dependencies
2. Test installation
3. **Prompt user to index now** (default: Yes)
4. If yes: Run `scripts/index_scriptures.py`
5. Show completion message with next steps

**Example:**
```bash
./install.sh

# Output includes:
Would you like to index scriptures for semantic search now?
This will:
  - Download AI model (~80MB, one-time)
  - Generate embeddings for all verses (5-10 minutes)
  - Enable AI-powered semantic search

Index now? (Y/n): y

# Indexing proceeds automatically...
```

### 2. `README.md`
**Updated:** Installation section

**Changes:**
- Added "Quick Install (Recommended)" section
- Highlighted auto-indexing feature
- Listed 4-step installation process
- Updated semantic search note

### 3. `QUICKSTART.md`
**Updated:** Installation and first steps

**Changes:**
- Added "Automated Installation" section
- Updated semantic search step
- Added note about indexing during install
- Clarified when manual indexing is needed

## Installation Flow Comparison

### Before (Manual)
```bash
cd /Users/hyrum/src/scriptorian
uv pip install -e .

# Later, separately:
# User must remember to run index_scriptures tool in Claude
# Or call search.index_scriptures() programmatically
```

### After (Automatic)
```bash
cd /Users/hyrum/src/scriptorian
./install.sh
# Prompted: Index now? (Y/n): y
# Indexing happens automatically
# Vector database persisted to disk
# Ready to use immediately
```

## Technical Details

### Indexing Process

1. **Load Data**
   - Read volumes.json for metadata
   - Load all ~6,000 verses from JSON files

2. **Initialize Model**
   - Download sentence-transformers model (~80MB, first run only)
   - Load into memory (~500MB RAM)

3. **Generate Embeddings**
   - Process in batches of 100 verses
   - Each verse → 384-dimensional vector
   - Show progress: `Progress: 2,500/6,000 verses (41.7%)`

4. **Store in Database**
   - Save vectors to ChromaDB
   - Store metadata (reference, book, chapter, verse)
   - Create HNSW index for fast similarity search

5. **Persist to Disk**
   - Save to `vector_db/` directory
   - ~45-50 MB total size
   - Reusable across sessions

### Time Requirements

- **First-time indexing**: 5-10 minutes
  - Model download: 1-2 minutes
  - Embedding generation: 4-8 minutes

- **Subsequent use**: Instant
  - Database loads from disk
  - No re-indexing needed

### Storage Requirements

- **Model cache**: ~80 MB (one-time)
- **Vector database**: ~50 MB
- **Total**: ~130 MB additional disk space

## User Experience Improvements

### Before Auto-Indexing

❌ User installs, tries semantic search
❌ Gets error: "Scriptures not yet indexed"
❌ Must run separate indexing step
❌ Confusion about how to enable semantic search

### After Auto-Indexing

✅ User runs `./install.sh`
✅ Prompted to index (default: Yes)
✅ Indexing completes during installation
✅ Semantic search works immediately
✅ Clear instructions if they skip indexing

## Backwards Compatibility

All existing methods still work:

1. **Via Claude Desktop**
   ```
   Please index the scriptures for semantic search
   ```

2. **Python API**
   ```python
   semantic_search.index_scriptures()
   ```

3. **Standalone Script**
   ```bash
   python scripts/index_scriptures.py
   ```

## Configuration Options

### Skip Auto-Indexing

If user wants to skip during installation:
```bash
./install.sh
# When prompted: Index now? (Y/n): n
```

### Silent Install (No Indexing)

For CI/CD or scripted installs:
```bash
echo "n" | ./install.sh
```

### Index Later

If skipped during install:
```bash
# Method 1: Standalone script
python scripts/index_scriptures.py

# Method 2: Via Claude Desktop
# Use the index_scriptures tool
```

## Testing

### Verify Installation
```bash
./install.sh
# Choose 'y' to index

# After completion, verify:
ls -lh vector_db/
# Should show ~45-50 MB of files

# Test search:
python -c "
from pathlib import Path
from scriptorian.data_loader import ScriptureLoader
from scriptorian.search import SemanticSearch

loader = ScriptureLoader(Path('polymer-citation-index/model'))
loader.load_volumes()

search = SemanticSearch(loader, db_path='vector_db')
search.initialize()

print(f'Indexed verses: {search.collection.count()}')
"
```

### Test Semantic Search
```python
from pathlib import Path
from scriptorian.data_loader import ScriptureLoader
from scriptorian.search import SemanticSearch

loader = ScriptureLoader(Path('polymer-citation-index/model'))
loader.load_volumes()

search = SemanticSearch(loader, db_path='vector_db')
search.initialize()

results = search.search("faith in Jesus Christ", n_results=3)
for r in results:
    print(f"{r.reference}: {r.verse_text[:50]}... (score: {r.score:.3f})")
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Scripts directory not found"
```bash
mkdir -p scripts
# Ensure index_scriptures.py is in scripts/
```

### "Permission denied: ./install.sh"
```bash
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

### "Index failed during install"
- Check disk space: `df -h`
- Check internet connection (for model download)
- Run manually: `python scripts/index_scriptures.py`

### "Already indexed" message
- If database exists, script asks for confirmation
- Choose 'y' to reindex or 'n' to skip

## Benefits

1. **Immediate Functionality**: Semantic search works right after install
2. **Better UX**: No confusing "not indexed" errors
3. **One Command**: Single `./install.sh` does everything
4. **Persistent**: Database saved to disk, no rebuild needed
5. **Optional**: Users can still skip and index later
6. **Informative**: Clear progress and completion messages

## Recommendations

### For New Users
✅ **Recommended:** Use `./install.sh` and choose 'y' for indexing

This gives you:
- Complete installation in one command
- Semantic search ready immediately
- Best first-time experience

### For Developers
✅ **Recommended:** Skip auto-indexing during rapid dev iterations

```bash
# Install dependencies only
uv pip install -e .

# Index once when needed
python scripts/index_scriptures.py
```

### For Production
✅ **Recommended:** Pre-index and deploy vector_db/

```bash
# On build machine:
./install.sh  # Choose 'y'
tar -czf vector_db.tar.gz vector_db/

# On deployment:
tar -xzf vector_db.tar.gz
# vector_db/ ready to use
```

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- [ ] Progress bar instead of percentage
- [ ] Parallel batch processing
- [ ] Resume interrupted indexing
- [ ] Incremental updates (add verses without full rebuild)
- [ ] Multiple embedding models
- [ ] GPU acceleration detection and use

## Summary

The auto-indexing feature makes Scriptorian's semantic search immediately accessible by:
1. Including indexing in the installation flow
2. Persisting the vector database to disk
3. Providing clear options for users to skip or defer
4. Maintaining backwards compatibility with all existing methods

**Result:** Better user experience with no additional complexity for those who want manual control.
